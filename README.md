**Kubernetes Mastery Repository**

Welcome to the Kubernetes Mastery repository, your comprehensive resource for mastering Kubernetes, the leading platform for container orchestration. This repository contains all the essential data and resources you need to become proficient in Kubernetes and excel in managing containerized applications.

**About Kubernetes:**

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It provides a robust framework for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of hosts.

Key features of Kubernetes include:

- **Container Orchestration:** Automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Facilitates communication between microservices and distributes traffic to maintain application availability and performance.
- **Automatic Bin Packing:** Optimizes resource utilization by automatically placing containers based on their resource requirements and constraints.
- **Self-Healing:** Restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, and kills containers that don't respond to user-defined health checks.
- **Secrets and Configuration Management:** Manages sensitive information and configuration details securely using Secrets.
